# Project
This is a simple ecoomerce peoject in react
I have used the following techniques
i. HTML       ii. CSS        iii. JavaScript           iv. React             v. Redux Toolkit             vi. Bootstrap
I have only made the the Home page containing items and bag module for calculations
NOTE: I have made this prjoect step by step with the help of a video tutorial and in this i have used an already made simple backend for data fetching
